Repository Explanation
Overview
This is a Next.js based blog application with a Hybrid Architecture. It combines two distinct systems:

Public Static Blog: Content is stored in Markdown (MDX) files and rendered statically.
Private Admin Dashboard: A dynamic interface (MongoDB + API) for managing a separate set of "quick" or "private" posts.
Important: The application currently has a "split personality". The main /posts URL serves the private admin dashboard, while the public blog posts are accessible via specific URLs but are not linked from the main navigation.

Entry Points & Structure
1. The Application Wrapper (
src/pages/_app.tsx
)
Role: The main entry point that wraps every page.
Function: Imports global styles (normalize.css, global.css) and renders the active page component.
2. The Admin Interface (Dynamic)
Running on MongoDB (defined in src/models/BlogEntry.ts).

Home (
src/pages/index.tsx
):
URL: /
Role: Login screen & Create Post form.
Flow: Checks cookies for auth -> Shows Login or Create Form -> Saves to MongoDB via /api/blogs.
Dashboard (
src/pages/posts/index.tsx
):
URL: /posts (Redirects here after login)
Role: Lists all MongoDB posts (not the MDX files).
Flow: Fetches data client-side from /api/blogs. Allows expanding, editing, and deleting posts inline.
3. The Public Blog (Static)
Running on MDX Files (stored in content/posts/).

Single Post (src/pages/posts/[post].tsx):
URL: /posts/my-post-slug
Role: Renders a single static blog post.
Flow:
Next.js calls getStaticPaths (reads all files in content/posts to generate URLs).
Next.js calls getStaticProps (reads the specific file content using src/lib/posts.ts).
Renders the PostLayout component with the content.
Paginated List (src/pages/posts/page/[page].tsx):
URL: /posts/page/1, /posts/page/2, etc.
Role: Lists the static MDX blog posts.
Note: This page exists but is not linked from the main navigation menu in the current state.
Tag List (src/pages/posts/tags/[[...slug]].tsx):
URL: /posts/tags/my-tag
Role: Lists static MDX posts filtered by tag.
Key Directories
Directory	Role
src/pages/api	Backend API routes. blogs.ts (CRUD for DB posts), login.ts (Auth), status.ts (DB Check).
src/lib	Logic for the static blog. posts.ts reads/parses MDX files. mongodb.ts connects to the DB.
content/posts	The actual content (text/images) for the static blog posts.
models	Mongoose schemas defining the structure of the dynamic DB data.
public	Static assets like images, fonts, and the admin styles.
How it Runs
Development:
Command: npm run dev (Runs next dev).
Starts server at http://localhost:3000.
Environment Variables:
Requires a MONGODB_URI (or similar) in .env.local to connect to the database, otherwise the dynamic parts (Admin/Login) will fail.
Deployment:
Next.js builds the static pages ([post].tsx) at build time.
API routes (/api/blogs) run as serverless functions (e.g., on Netlify/Vercel) to handle the dynamic DB interactions.
Summary of Data Flow
MDX Flow: File System (content/) -> lib/posts.ts -> getStaticProps -> React Component -> Browser (HTML).
DB Flow: User Input -> API Route (/api/blogs) -> Mongoose Model -> MongoDB Atlas -> API Route -> React Component state -> Browser (DOM).
